#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

    'There’s always a song playing in my head
    \nEither one I heard, or one I made up
    \nThe wind talks to me 
    \n(I fill - feel - write down)
    \n(I fill - feel - write down)
    \nEvery wave I read
    \n(I eye ‘em well)
    \nEvery wave I taste
    \n(I savor it)
    \nThere’s nothing that can kill me, because I did that before
    \nThere’s no destroying what came back for her soul…')
